### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and launch
1. Clone the project (To clone, you need to install [Github cli](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/daniojey/Pilot-project.git
```
2. Go to the project folder after successful cloning
```bash
    cd Pilot-project.git
```
3. Create a virtual environment using the command
```bash
    python -m venv <Name of environment>
```
4. After that, you will need to log in every time to interact with the project correctly.
> Activation of the virtual environment
```bash
    <Name of environment>/Scripts/activate
```
> If you need to exit it
```bash
    deactivate
```
5. Establishing project dependencies
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. We are waiting for the installation to complete, after which we will proceed as follows
```
    main/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py 
```
7. Go to line 115 of the code in settings.py.
> This segment will contain the following code
```bash
    DATABASES = {
        "default": dj_database_url.config(
            default="postgres://test:root@localhost:5432/Tests", conn_max_age=600
        )
    }
```
8. Download one of the latest versions of PostgreSql, then open pgadmin4 (the application that was installed along with Postgresql services):
   8.1. Create a user in the ‚ÄúLogin/Group Roles‚Äù section.
       > Set your password, which will be used later, as well as in Previleges.
   8.2. Create a new Databases
       > In owner, select the user you created.

9. Now you need to change the URL specified in DATABASES in settings.py, which you can edit.
```bash
    default="postgres://<Name of the created user>:<User password>@localhost:5432/<Name of the created database>", conn_max_age=600
```

10. Project launch
```bash
    python manage.py runserver
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Django Secret key is required to access the project (optional feature, but mandatory for production)
>[You can generate a key here](https://djecrety.ir/)
> Only put the key in the .env file in the project root (if you haven't made a .env file yet, you can do that to add the django-secret-key and also connect extra features later).
```env
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = <Your secret key>
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|----------|
| `python manage.py runserver` | Server startup |
